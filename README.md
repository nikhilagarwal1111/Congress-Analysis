**Bar Chart of the number of Senators from each party who are up for election in the next three General Elections

This bar chart shows the term limits of Senators in the US Senate right now. As you can see from the bar chart, more Republicans will be up for re-election in 2022 and 2024, but Democrats will have significantly Senators up for re-election in 2026.

**Line plot of the number of representatives born in each decade from each party

This line plot generally shows how old each party's representatives are, as it records the number of representatives born in each decade, spanning from the 1930's up until the 1990's. From the line plot, we can see that the Democratic Party's representatives are on average slightly older, as their distribution is more positively skewed, and their median birth year falls somewhere in the 50's. On the other hand, Republicans have a slightly more symmetrical distribution, with their median birth year likely being somewhere in the 60's.
